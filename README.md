# PigMath

## Purpose

A free to use, lightweight, header-only math library written in C.

## Use

PigMath is a header-only library. The header file `pigmath.h` is located in the
`includes` folder. Simply place this in your project somewhere (preferably in
a dedicated "includes" location) and reference it using
`#include <(path)/pigmath.h>`.
