# PigMath

## Purpose

An open source, lightweight, header-only math library written in C.

For more information on usage and implementation, see the [documentation](documentation/documentation.md).

## Use

PigMath is a header-only library. The header file `pigmath.h` is located in the `includes` folder. Simply place this in your project somewhere (preferably in a dedicated "includes" location) and reference it using

`#include <(path)/pigmath.h>`.

## Name

Why name it PigMath? Most of my nicknames and usernames over the years have included "pig" in some form as a play on my last name. I figured I would continue that trend solely for my own delusional continuity.
